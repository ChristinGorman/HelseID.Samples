## Sample API

Other HelseID samples are configured to use this API. Run the API locally before trying to connect through other HelseID samples.

When you run the API locally you will get a <strong>http error 401</strong> since the API requires authentication before the client can access data. Thus, you should connect through other HelseID samples in order to authenticate and get access to the API.

#### HelseID samples that are configured to use the API:
* [API Access](https://github.com/NorskHelsenett/HelseID.Samples/tree/Ingvild-samples/HelseId.APIAccess)
* [API Access with a new token](https://github.com/NorskHelsenett/HelseID.Samples/tree/Ingvild-samples/HelseId.APIAccessNewToken)
* [API Access with resource indicators]() ...
