## Client Credentials Grant

The client credentials grant type is commonly used for server-to-server interactions that must run in the background, without immediate interaction with a user. The sample demonstrates how to generate a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) that is used to request access to a web-server. An access token is returned and written to the console if the request was approved.


### Requirements

The [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) is required to build the program.

#### To run the sample:
```
dotnet build
dotnet run
```
