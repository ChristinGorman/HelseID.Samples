## Client Credentials Grant

The client credentials grant type is commonly used for server-to-server interactions that must run in the background, without immediate interaction with a user. The sample demonstrates how to generate a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) that is used to request access to a web-server. An access token is returned and written to the console if the request was approved.
